    "Limit Texas Hold'em is a game of imperfect information. In any game the hole cards of each player are hidden and, so you must predict how your opponent will act in various situations. This requires predictions of actions given certain hand attributes. Each action can be classified as either a fold, call, or raise. Hold'em is an interesting game with many nuances that are not understood by the general public. \n",

    "The original idea for a project creating an opponent model for poker came from [AlphaGo](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/alphago/AlphaGoNaturePaper.pdf), a perfect information game. They started their training process by training a supervised maching using match histories of high amateur players. They then improved upon there inital predictions using partial solving and Monte Carlo Tree Search to create their final agent. Extending this to an imperfect information game would require a similar process.\n",

    "Opponent Modeling in Poker](https://github.com/zachwdawson/DS4400FinalProject/blob/main/7132-30507-1-PB.pdf) supervised learning models were trained successfully to predict specific players actions given hand histories from that players games. There were also two books [1](https://github.com/zachwdawson/DS4400FinalProject/blob/main/2006_Book_ComputersAndGames.pdf) [2](https://github.com/zachwdawson/DS4400FinalProject/blob/main/poker%20metrics%20calculation.pdf) that went through various metrics and techniques for making creating poker AI. Many of the metrics used for features are calculated using algorithms from these works.\n",

    "Unfortunately, many of these features could not be extracted as they were too computationally expensive. PPOT and NPOT required iterating over all possible runouts of ocmmunal cards and calculate if you win or your opponent. It must also iterate over all opponent possible hands, which ends up being extraordinarily large, so these features could not be extraacted. As such, winning probability is a much simpler approximation than the formula layed out by Billings, which used both PPOT and NPOT in the calculation. Hand strength and rank are determined using [eval7](https://github.com/julianandrews/pyeval7), a python hand evaluator, which quickly determines how strong your hand is relative to all other hands. All other features are made simply by saving the previous actions from the hand and determining raise amounts and stack committed for your opponent and yourself. All feature extraction was run using python scripts that dumped into a csv that can be seen below."

    "This shows the percentage of each action as the dealer and not as the dealer. Clearly the dealer is incentivised to push the action as they are the last to act in each betting round. This means that they can gain more information before making their decision and can therfore be more agressive. These ranges would look very different in a no limit holdem game but limit holdem incentivises longer hands, as you are never able to raise the pot to astronomical sizes and can therefore never lose your entire stack."

    "This chart shows the hands that are being played by each opponent at each stage of the game. Most hands start as a high card except pocket pairs and they rapidly dwindle, as making good hands are rare. It is interesting to see that players play with drawing cards (ie. high card) with a hope to improve, but will not play those at the river, as they no longer have any chance to improve. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create data that could be input into a dataframe, an immense amount of preprocessing was needed. Iterating over each line and creating Hand objects. Hand objects had players which had various player statistics as well as a list of actions. A Hand object was then used to create a list of Decisions. Decisions take in various traits like the hole cards of the player, the communal cards, the actual decision made, and other hand statistics. These traits are then used to calculate the various features and written to a csv that can be loaded as a decision dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, most of the feature normalization is very simple, as most are either discrete values or simple numerical values.\n",
    "* Note: I would like to hear ideas on any feature normalization I have overlooked or feature extraction ideas before moving on to train more models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models\n",
    "\n",
    "I trained one model as I have had to spend so much time extracting the features and the performance was decent, especially in a game that is inherently random. The results can be seen below. I used recursive feature elimination and cross-validated selection to train a random forest classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note: We discussed using Random Forests and SVM but if there are other models you would reccommend after seeing the final data I would like to hear it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges/Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "I originally wanted to do no limit hold'em instead of limit hold'em and I wanted to use multiple players at the table. Both of those things became quickly intractable, as the dataset I had did not show hole cards unless they were shown down, making it impossible to extract the features I wanted for each decision. Limit hold'em also has only 3 actions fold, check, raise, whereas no limit holdem allows for raises of any size, making the state space exceptionally large."
